[SonicBirth v1.3.1(not v1.3.0)](http://www.radio.uqam.ca/ambisonic/sonicbirth_v131 _beta2.zip)

32bit vst-enabled DAW 

*As the SonicBirth1.3's development was stopped in 2007 and not has been maintained,it may not work correctly on your environment.

On my macbook pro (mid 2010,Yosemite and Tracktion6,Live8 or Live9),it works well.

## Usage

+ Run SonicBirth.app(v1.3.1).
+ open this swarms.sbc file.
+ File > Install as VST...

Now you can play the swarms.vst by following your DAW's instruction.
